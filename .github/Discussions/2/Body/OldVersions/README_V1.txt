This is the discussion place for feature requests and general info on how the SVG Video format can be created, optimized, and released.

The general rule for the SVG video format is that the format has to be as light as possible, but still be a lossless and expandable format. The benefits of using SVG drawing methods for videos is the significant reduction in file size compared to other video formats, along with the easy customization of the data, and the significant reduction of data required for video.
