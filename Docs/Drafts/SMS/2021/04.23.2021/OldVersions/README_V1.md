I am wondering if you would like to help contribute to one of my older, advanced projects. It is a video codec that I hope can become a W3C standard (it is an extension to the W3C SVG standard) the idea is for a powerful video codec that is fully SVG based with a replaceable header that defines different ways to encode different video styles and define looped content (such as those pesky 1.2-36.8 GiB 10 hour videos) The project is located here: https://github.com/seanpm2001/SVG_Video 

The project is currently written in C++ but I will accept contributions in C, Python, Assembly, Shell, and XML for all portions (select portions can additionally be written in C#, F#, Swift, Objective-C++, and Java for platform dependant portions based on Windows, MacOS, and iOS/iPadOS)

Pros:

• Video can be upscaled to any desired resolution (480p video can be easily upscaled to 2160p or higher with little or no loss of detail)

• Video will take up 2-9999+ times less space than the equivalent in MP4, WebM, and other formats

• Video will be completely open source with no binary blobs, as the source code of each video container file can be read by both humans and machines and will be easily modifiable without a hex editor

• Looped content will take up much less space (see above)

Known cons

• The format may be incredibly difficult to program due to its complexity

• The format may be CPU intensive (new, April 23rd 2021)
