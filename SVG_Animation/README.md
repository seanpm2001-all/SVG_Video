# SVG Animation samples

These are examples of SVG Animation, an older, less popular SVG Animation standard that predates this project by over 20 years (SVG Animation V1 was published in 1999)

## Major differences

The 2 formats are drastically different, but similar in some ways. It would be an unfair comparison, as it would be like comparing GIF to MP4, they both can be used for animation, but are still completely different formats. In this example, animated SVG (.svg) is GIF, and SVG video (.svg_vid, .svg_video) is MP4.
